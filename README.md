# Image-Sound

## About
A tool that converts images into audio files and back again. This project implements image-to-sound steganography, allowing you to:
- Convert any image file into an MP3 audio file
- Decode the audio file back to reconstruct the original image

## How it Works
The application works by:
1. Reading the image pixel data (RGB values)
2. Converting pixel values into audio frequencies/waveforms
3. Generating an MP3 file from these audio signals
4. Providing decoding functionality to reconstruct the image from audio

## Implementation Options
The project can be implemented in either:
- **Python** (Recommended)
  - Libraries: PIL/Pillow (image processing), PyDub (audio), NumPy (data manipulation)
  - Easier implementation with extensive audio/image libraries
  - Better for prototyping

- **C++**
  - Libraries: OpenCV (image processing), LAME/libmp3lame (MP3 encoding)
  - Better performance for large files
  - More complex implementation but faster execution

## Current Status
ðŸš§ Under Development

## Technical Considerations
- Image data preservation during audio conversion
- Audio file size optimization
- Error correction for accurate image reconstruction
- Supported image formats and resolutions
